# PYTHON-ile-ucak-fotograflarini-kullanarak-ucak-modeli-tahmini
This project aims to analyze the aircraft photos in the satellite imagery and identify the model or type of each aircraft. Different models such as VGG16, KNN and SVM were used for this purpose.
We have 5 types of airplane models.
Airplane images on this project are from MTARSI.
